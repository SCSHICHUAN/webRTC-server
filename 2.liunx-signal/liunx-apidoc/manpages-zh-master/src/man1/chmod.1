.SH 描述
本手册页记录了 GNU 版本的 \fBchmod\fP。\fBchmod\fP 根据给定
\fI模式\fP改变每个给出文件的模式比特位，其模式字符串既可以是修改目标的符号表示，也可以是用一个八进制数字来代表新的模式比特位形式。
.PP
The format of a symbolic mode is
[\fBugoa\fP.\|.\|.][[\fB\-+=\fP][\fIperms\fP.\|.\|.].\|.\|.], where \fIperms\fP is either
zero or more letters from the set \fBrwxXst\fP, or a single letter from the set
\fBugo\fP.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas.
.PP
A combination of the letters \fBugoa\fP controls which users' access to the
file will be changed: the user who owns it (\fBu\fP), other users in the file's
group (\fBg\fP), other users not in the file's group (\fBo\fP), or all users
(\fBa\fP).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if (\fBa\fP) were given,
but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.
.PP
The operator \fB+\fP causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the
existing file mode bits of each file; \fB\-\fP causes them to be removed; and
\fB=\fP causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed
except that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not
affected.
.PP
The letters \fBrwxXst\fP select file mode bits for the affected users: read
(\fBr\fP), write (\fBw\fP), execute (or search for directories)  (\fBx\fP),
execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute
permission for some user (\fBX\fP), set user or group ID on execution (\fBs\fP),
restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (\fBt\fP).  Instead of one or more of
these letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters \fBugo\fP: the
permissions granted to the user who owns the file (\fBu\fP), the permissions
granted to other users who are members of the file's group (\fBg\fP), and the
permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding
categories (\fBo\fP).
.PP
A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0\-7), derived by adding up
the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be leading
zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and
restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects
permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute
(1); the third selects permissions for other users in the file's group, with
the same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's group,
with the same values.
.PP
\fBchmod\fP never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the \fBchmod\fP
system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem since
the permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for each
symbolic link listed on the command line, \fBchmod\fP changes the permissions
of the pointed\-to file.  In contrast, \fBchmod\fP ignores symbolic links
encountered during recursive directory traversals.
.SH "SETUID 和 SETGID 比特位"
\fBchmod\fP clears the set\-group\-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group
ID does not match the user's effective group ID or one of the user's
supplementary group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges.
Additional restrictions may cause the set\-user\-ID and set\-group\-ID bits of
\fIMODE\fP or \fIRFILE\fP to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and
functionality of the underlying \fBchmod\fP system call.  When in doubt, check
the underlying system behavior.
.PP
For directories \fBchmod\fP preserves set\-user\-ID and set\-group\-ID bits unless
you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or clear the bits with
symbolic modes like \fBu+s\fP and \fBg\-s\fP.  To clear these bits for directories
with a numeric mode requires an additional leading zero, or leading = like
\fB00755\fP , or \fB=755\fP
.SH "RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT"
The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose
interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it prevents
unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless
they own the file or the directory; this is called the \fIrestricted deletion
flag\fP for the directory, and is commonly found on world\-writable directories
like \fB/tmp\fP.  For regular files on some older systems, the bit saves the
program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when
run; this is called the \fIsticky bit\fP.
.SH 选项
.PP
将每个文件的权限模式变更至指定模式。使用 \fB\-\-reference\fP 选项时，把指定文件的模式设置为与参考文件相同。
.TP 
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-changes\fP
类似 verbose 选项，但只在做出修改时进行报告
.TP 
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-silent\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
隐藏大多数错误信息
.TP 
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
对每一个处理的文件输出诊断信息
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-preserve\-root\fP
不要对“/”特别对待（默认）
.TP 
\fB\-\-preserve\-root\fP
不要在“/”下进行递归操作
.TP 
\fB\-\-reference\fP=\fI\,参考文件\/\fP
使用参考文件的模式作为具体模式值
.TP

递归修改文件和目录
.TP 
\fB\-\-help\fP
显示此帮助信息并退出
.TP 
\fB\-\-version\fP
显示版本信息并退出
.PP
每个模式字符串都应该匹配如下格式："[ugoa]*([\-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[\-+=][0\-7]+"。
